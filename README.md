# Grocery-store-website
Developed a responsive grocery store website called FreshMart using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a user-friendly interface that enhances the shopping experience. It is fully responsive, adapting to different devices and screen sizes. Users can conveniently purchase groceries online, with features like intuitive search functionality, clear navigation, and visually appealing product displays. The website includes a cart system for adding, updating, and removing items. It offers a secure checkout process for seamless transactions. FreshMart's customers benefit from the convenience and time-saving aspect of online grocery shopping. Overall, the project showcases my skills in web development and my ability to create a responsive and user-friendly e-commerce platform
